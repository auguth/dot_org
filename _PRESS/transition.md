# Transitioning to a Section 8 Non-Profit Organization

### TLDR
We are excited to announce our transition of activities from a Private Limited Organization ("Auguth Tech Private Limited") to Auguth Research Foundation, now officially recognized as a Section 8 Non-Profit Organization. This shift allows us to focus on our mission of improving internet protocols and promoting open-source education across India. Our goals include community outreach, collaboration, and advancing technology for social good.

### What is a Section 8 Non-Profit Organization?
A Section 8 Non-Profit Organization is registered under the Companies Act of 2013 in India. Its primary purpose is to promote social welfare, education, and research. Unlike traditional for-profit entities, Section 8 organizations operate without the intention of generating profits for shareholders. Instead, any surplus income is reinvested to further the organization’s objectives. This structure empowers us to dedicate ourselves fully to our mission of making the internet a better place for all.

### Reasons for Transition

#### A Commitment to the Greater Good
As we navigated our journey, it became increasingly clear that our focus needed to shift from profit-driven motives to social impact. The digital landscape poses numerous challenges that require thoughtful, collaborative solutions. Transitioning to a Section 8 Non-Profit allows us to prioritize the needs of the community and society at large, ensuring that our work benefits everyone.

#### Enhanced Focus on Research and Education
In our previous structure, while we made strides in research and protocol development, the focus was often constrained by business considerations. By transitioning to a non-profit model, we can channel our resources more effectively into impactful research and educational initiatives. This newfound focus will allow us to engage communities throughout India, fostering a culture of knowledge-sharing and innovation.

#### Aligning with Our Core Values
At our core, we believe in the power of open-source technologies and their potential to drive positive change. Our transition allows us to advocate more vigorously for open-source initiatives, emphasizing the importance of transparency, collaboration, and accessibility. We are committed to ensuring that the digital tools we develop serve the public interest and promote inclusivity.
